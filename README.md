# How to Run
1. Make sure you have JDBC downloaded and integrated into
your project. There are many ways to do this, I just added the
Jar file to the project structure.
2. Run the createDB script in the DB_scripts in your pgAdmin
to create the initial DB
3. Run the main() method in StudentDatabaseApp.java
